# Water-consumptionController
Drink more water -> live longer and happier life :)
# Introduction 
Hi! I'm sure that you're aware of the fact how water is essential for our body. 
It supports metabolism, lubricates joints, helps our body with absorbing nutrients,
regulates temperature etc.

Water-consumptionController(WCC) is designed to help you adjust your water 
consumption and thus make you healthier and feel well :)

# How to use
Functionality is fantastically simple. In application you have a field, where
you write how much water you've just drunk, app saves data and demonstrates
progress bar with current water volume consumed during a day in percent. When the day ends up,
you should click "reset" button to clean the progress bar. Full bar tells you that you've
consumed 2 litres of water - recommended norm for every person to consume each day.

## Take care of your health :)
